## Question about the model?

If you have questions about collecting data against the model, a request for changes, or a general model inquiry, please create an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Pan-Canadian-Genome-Library/PCGL-data-model-feedback/issues). The issue tracker is monitored by the PCGL team developing the data model and data submission system, and we respond regularly to issues.
